Paita is textual asssistant on your terminal that supports multiple AI Services' Chat Models.

## Key Features
1. **Supports Multiple AI Services:** paita integrates a variety of AI services through the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) library, which means any service compatible with LangChain can be added to paita for use. Currently OpenAI and AWS Bedrock are supported.                                                                                          
2. **Use Your Own AI Model:** You have full control over your AI model deployment and configuration when using Bedrock within paita, ensuring exclusive access and extensive customization of model parameters.
3. **Sophisticated Terminal UI Based on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/):** paita uses the Textual framework to provide an advanced user interface right within your terminal, combining the complexity of a GUI with console simplicity.                                                                                       
4. **Easy Installation and Setup:** Installing paita is as simple as running 'pip install paita', followed by configuring your chosen AI service and model according to their specific 
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems across most terminals; if Python runs in your environment and Textual supports it, then so does paita.
