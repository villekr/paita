Paita is textual asssistant on your terminal that supports multiple AI Services' Chat Models.

## Key Features
1. **Supports Multiple AI Services:** Paita integrates a variety of AI services through the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) library, which means any service compatible with LangChain can be added to Paita for use.                                                                                                   
2. **Use Your Own AI Model:** You have full control over your AI model deployment and configuration when using Bedrock within Paita, ensuring exclusive access and extensive customization of model parameters.
3. **Sophisticated Terminal UI Based on [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/):** Paita uses the Textual framework to provide an advanced user interface right within your terminal, combining the complexity of a GUI with console simplicity.
